# EDINET API Tools :jp:

This project provides a set of tools for interacting with Japan's [EDINET](https://disclosure2.edinet-fsa.go.jp/) (Electronic Disclosure for Investors Network) API v2. It focuses on downloading, processing, and performing **structured analysis** of financial disclosure documents using the `llm` library.

Leverage the power of Large Language Models to extract specific, structured insights from unstructured financial text.

## Features

- ðŸ“… Retrieve and filter disclosure documents by type and date range using the EDINET API
- ðŸ“‚ Download and process ZIP files containing XBRL-derived CSV data
- ðŸ§¹ Clean and process text data from financial disclosures
- ðŸ“Š Structured Analysis: Analyze processed disclosure data using LLMs (via the `llm` library) to extract information conforming to predefined schemas.
- ðŸ¤– Flexible LLM Backend: Use any LLM supported by the `llm` library (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local models, etc.) by changing configuration.
- ðŸªµ Detailed Logging: Provides visibility into the data fetching, processing, and analysis steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (Required by the `llm` library and recent dependencies)
- EDINET API key
- LLM API key (Optional for fetching EDINET data, but required by the LLM analysis features. This could be an OpenAI key, Anthropic key, etc., depending on the `llm` model chosen).
- Necessary LLM plugins installed if using models other than the default OpenAI ones.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matthelmer/edinet-api-tools.git
    cd edinet-tools
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    -   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  Install required packages (this includes the `llm` library and its dependencies):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Install any `llm` plugins needed for the specific LLMs you want to use (e.g., for Claude, Gemini, local models):
    ```bash
    llm install llm-anthropic # Example for Anthropic models
    llm install llm-gemini    # Example for Google Gemini models
    llm install llm-gpt4all   # Example for local GPT4All models
    # See https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html for more
    ```

5.  Set up environment variables:
    -   Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    -   Add your API keys and specify your desired LLM:
        ```dotenv
        EDINET_API_KEY=<your_edinet_api_key>

        # --- LLM Configuration ---
        # Use LLM_API_KEY OR a specific key like OPENAI_API_KEY depending on your LLM
        # If using OpenAI, OPENAI_API_KEY is sufficient.
        # If using other models via llm plugins, check their documentation.
        # Example for OpenAI:
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
        LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o # Or 'claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gemini-2.5-flash-04-17', etc.
        LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo # Optional: A model to try if LLM_MODEL fails

        # If using Azure OpenAI:
        # AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_openai_api_key>
        # AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your_azure_openai_endpoint>
        # AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=<your_azure_openai_api_version>
        # AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<your_azure_openai_deployment_name>
        # Ensure LLM_MODEL is set to your Azure deployment name if using this.
        ```
        You can also use `llm keys set <key_name>` to manage keys independently for LLM plugins. Check the specific plugin documentation or `llm models --options` for details on how each model expects its key. Setting the key in the `.env` file using the expected environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) is often the simplest approach that works with the `llm` library.

6.  Ensure your virtual environment (venv) is activated whenever you use these tools.

## Usage

Run the demo script to see the tools in action:

```bash
python demo.py
```

This will:
- Fetch documents of supported types (Semi-Annual, Extraordinary Reports) from the most recent day with filings.
- Download the corresponding ZIP files.
- Process the CSV data within the ZIPs into a structured format.
- Run multiple analysis tools (configured in `llm_analysis_tools.py`) using your specified LLM to generate structured summaries and insights from the processed data.
- Print the analysis results to the console.

## Main Components

-   `edinet_tools.py`: Functions for interacting with the EDINET API (fetching lists, downloading documents), includes retry logic and error handling.
-   `utils.py`: Utility functions for file processing (encoding detection, CSV reading) and text cleaning. Handles extracting data from the complex ZIP archive structure.
-   `document_processors.py`: Contains classes (`BaseDocumentProcessor`, `ExtraordinaryReportProcessor`, `SemiAnnualReportProcessor`, `GenericReportProcessor`) for processing raw CSV data into a structured dictionary format, tailored to different document types.
-   `llm_analysis_tools.py`: Defines the framework for LLM-based structured analysis using Pydantic schemas and the `llm` library. Contains specific tools (like `OneLinerTool`, `ExecutiveSummaryTool`) and the dispatcher function `analyze_document_data`.
-   `config.py`: Handles environment variable loading and defines global configurations like supported document types and default LLM models.
-   `logging_config.py`: Sets up basic logging for the application.
-   `demo.py`: Demonstration script showing the tool's capabilities and orchestrating the workflow.

## Customization

-   **Analysis Tools:** Modify `llm_analysis_tools.py` to create new analysis tools. Define a Pydantic schema for the desired output, create a class inheriting from `BasePromptTool`, implement `create_prompt` and `format_to_text`, and add your new tool to the `TOOL_MAP`.
-   **Document Processing:** Add new classes inheriting from `BaseDocumentProcessor` in `document_processors.py` to handle specific document types (beyond 160 and 180). Add your processor to the `processor_map` in `document_processors.process_raw_csv_data`.
-   **Supported Document Types:** Update the `SUPPORTED_DOC_TYPES` dictionary in `config.py`.
